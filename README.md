# perturbation
compare the error sensitivity between the Michaelis–Menten equation and the Lineweaver–Burk equation
hypothesize a catalytic kinetic case
Km is 1 mM and Vmax is 30 μM/min
the corresponding equation is v=30*c/(1+c)
v is the initial velocity and c is the substrate concentration
three types of error were introduced, including perturbation of c, perturbation of v, and simultaneous perturbation of them
