# perturbation
Compare the error sensitivity between the Michaelis–Menten equation and the Lineweaver–Burk equation. 
Hypothesize a catalytic kinetic case. 
Km is 1 mM and Vmax is 30 μM/min. 
The corresponding equation is v=30*c/(1+c). 
v is the initial velocity and c is the substrate concentration. 
Three types of error were introduced, including perturbation of c, perturbation of v, and simultaneous perturbation of them.
